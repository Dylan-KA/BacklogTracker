## ðŸ”¨ Build Standalone .EXE

Use this command to build a self-contained, single-file Windows executable:

dotnet publish -f:net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0 -c Release -r win-x64 -p:PublishSingleFile=true --self-contained true -o win-exe

Make sure your .csproj includes this to disable MSIX packaging:

<WindowsPackageType>None</WindowsPackageType>

The output .exe will be located in the win-exe/ folder.
